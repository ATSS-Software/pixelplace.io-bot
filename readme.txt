Dear reader,
Hello. This is a bot i created for pixelplace.io. Please only use it on world 7 because 
i dont want my reputation tarnished so i can be moderator of world 8. Do not delete anything because my program 
has lots of dependancies! Upload an image then open pixelplace. Close the chat then press Ctrl + Shift + J.
Type in the following commands in the console.

CONFIG.canvas.chillTime = 0-100
CONFIG.canvas.minZoom = 1
CONFIG.canvas.maxZoom = 1

When you have typed the commands open the press Control + G. 
You will see a preview of your picture hovering by your cursor. Match up the picture with where you want it to go. Then
click and Voila! If you ever want it to stop press Control + G. To unpause press Control + G again. Goodbye.

Sincerly,
Taksony of the Sassanian guild
